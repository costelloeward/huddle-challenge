## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties including flex and media queries


### What I learned

To build the mobile version first and then add a media query for the larger size!
The facebook icon needs specific padding to be circular.
Use diimensions rather than percentages with the border-radius to get a pill shape for a button.


### Continued development

I want to improve my understanding of media queries, flexbox and how CSS will change with the incoming container queries feature. 



### Useful resources

- [W3schools documentation on images](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_images.asp) - This helped me work out how to make the mockup image responsive to different device sizes.
