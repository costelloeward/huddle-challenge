## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See active states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties including flex and media queries


### What I learned

To build the mobile version first and then add a media query for the larger size!


### Continued development

I want to improve my understanding of media queries, flexbox and how CSS will change with the incoming container queries feature. 



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_images.asp) - This helped me work out how to make the mockup image responsive to different device sizes.
